# Nothing to See Here!

This is a work-in-progress project where I'm gradually building out a Go package for database handling, primarily with PostgreSQL. I'm learning by doing — and yes, I'm reinventing a few wheels along the way.

The goal is to create a lightweight, reflection-based helper library that supports:
- Dynamic table creation from struct definitions
- Metadata-driven constraints (`unique`, `required`, `on_delete`, etc.)
- Simple insert and select helpers
- SQL generation with support for joins and conditions

This is as much a learning tool as it is a usable package. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome — but keep in mind this is under active experimentation.
